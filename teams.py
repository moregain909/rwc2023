Other than their failure to win a Rugby World Cup, they have the best record of any European team – registering as many wins as 2003 champions England but with more points scored.\nHaving come so close to glory in 1987, 1999 and 2011, Les Bleus will be looking to put the record straight and go all the way when they host the tournament for a second time in 2023.\nWe take a look at France’s Rugby World Cup story.\nRWC debut: 23 May, 1987 v Scotland at Lancaster Park, Christchurch\nRWC appearances: Played 52 – Won 36 Drawn 1 Lost 15 – Points for 1,585 Points against 966 – Win ratio 69 per cent\nMost RWC appearances: Raphaël Ibañez, 18 (1999-2007)\nMost RWC tries: Vincent Clerc, 11\nBest finish: Runners-up (1987, 1999, 2011)\nQualification for RWC 2023: Quarter-finalists at RWC 2019\nMost memorable match: The RWC 1999 semi-final versus New Zealand at Twickenham. The 43-31 victory may not be the biggest comeback in Rugby World Cup history – that honour falls to Romania – but it was the greatest given the stakes and the opposition in front of them. With the score at 24-10 to the All Blacks, France looked dead and buried, but they pulled out all the stops to score 33 unanswered points in a\xa0 scintillating half an hour or so of rugby.\nIconic moment: Serge Blanco’s dive for the corner of the Concord Oval pitch to finish off a free-flowing move and secure France a place in the final of RWC 1987 at the expense of co-hosts Australia.\nLow point: Sébastien Vahaamahina’s red card against Wales in the quarter-final of Rugby World Cup 2019. The France second-row did himself and his team no favours by elbowing Aaron Wainwright in the face, an act of violence that received a straight red card and left Les Bleus playing the last half-hour with 14 men. The dismissal – with France leading 19-10 \xa0– proved to be game-changing as Wales clawed their way back to win 20-19.\nIconic player: Serge Blanco. An award that could so easily have gone to another Serge, the hard-as-nails flanker Serge Betsen who, alongside Thierry Dusautoir, tackled the All Blacks to a standstill in their RWC 2007 quarter-final. However, the swaggering play of Blanco from full-back best summed up Les Bleus at their best.\nRecord-breaker: Emile and Romain Ntamack became the first father-son combination to represent France on the game’s biggest stage when Romain was selected for Les Bleus’ opening match of RWC 2019 against Argentina in Tokyo. Emile played for Les Bleus in the 1995 and 1999 tournaments.\nDid you know? Half-back Jean-Marc Doussain became the first player to make his test debut in a Rugby World Cup final when he took to the field five minutes from the end of the 2011 showpiece against New Zealand. At 20 years and 253 days, he was the third-youngest player to play in a final.\nQuote: “I feel immensely sad and immensely proud at the same time. People have always said and thought that the All Blacks were the greatest team of all time, but tonight I think it’s the France team that was great, and even immense. It’s tough to take, we needed a little bit more.” – France coach Marc Lièvremont expresses his feelings after their RWC 2011 final defeat by hosts New Zealand.\n')), \

England had no answer to the rampaging winger and lost 45-29 despite scoring four tries themselves.\nIconic moment: John Kirwan’s try in the very first Rugby World Cup game in 1987 has stood the test of time. The winger set off on a slaloming run from deep inside his own 22 that saw him beat nine Italian defenders on his way to the line. It gave the fledgling tournament just the start it needed to capture the public’s imagination.\nLow point: New Zealand blew a 13-3 half-time lead against France to lose 20-18 in 2007 and crash out at the quarter-final stages of a Rugby World Cup for the first and only time in their history. There were calls for coach Graham Henry to lose his job as a result, but he rewarded the New Zealand Rugby Union’s faith in him by delivering the 2011 title, the All Blacks’ first in 24 years.\nIconic player: Jonah Lomu burst onto the scene in 1995 and never looked back despite all the health problems that later came to light. Labelled ‘a freak’ in the most complimentary of ways by England captain Will Carling, Lomu’s sheer size and speed made him an unstoppable force. He scored 15 tries across the 1995 and 1999 tournaments, a record until Bryan Habana matched his tally in 2015.\nRecord-breaker: Richie McCaw captained his country a record 13 times at a Rugby World Cup and is the only man to lift the Webb Ellis Cup twice, in 2011 and 2015.\nDid you know? New Zealand are the only team in Rugby World Cup history to have a 100 per cent record in the pool stages.\nQuote: “I’m so proud of the team. To win back-to-back World Cups is a dream come true. It’s a pretty strong group of guys. We try to do things no other team has done before... it’s a special feeling to be part of such a great team.” – Dan Carter after his man-of-the-match performance in the RWC 2015 final at Twickenham.\n')), \

The All Blacks led 16-3 at half-time but a determined performance from Italy after the break saw them ‘win’ the second half 18-15 for a final scoreline of 31-21 to the defending champions.\nIconic moment: Scoring the first drop goal at a Rugby World Cup, Swiss-born centre Oscar Collodo entered the history books when he reduced New Zealand's lead by three points in the 39th minute of the opening match of the inaugural tournament in 1987. There have been 139 more drop goals in the tournament since.\xa0\nLow point: Victory over Scotland in their final pool match at RWC 2007 would have seen the Azzurri qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time. Captain Alessandro Troncon scored the only try of the game in Saint-Étienne but six penalties from the boot of Chris Paterson saw the Scots edge the decider 18-16. A real missed opportunity.\nIconic player: Sergio Parisse. The Azzurri’s greatest-ever player is one of just three players in history to have competed in five editions of the global showpiece. He joined fellow back-row and countryman Mauro Bergamasco and Samoa’s Brian Lima by achieving the feat at Japan 2019.\nRecord-breaker: Diego Dominguez set the record for most points scored in a Rugby World Cup match by an Italian (21) when he converted his own try and one other as well as kicking four penalties in a 31-25 win against Argentina at RWC 1995. Rima Wakarua matched the feat in 2003.\nDid you know? Italy have been drawn in the same pool as New Zealand on no less than six occasions.\nQuote: “I am proud of the things I have done in my career and am just glad to have been able to have been part of this experience, this World Cup. It was a very big effort tonight and we are all very unhappy, obviously, with the result, but we gave it everything and I could ask no more.” – Alessandro Troncon laments missing out on a fairytale ending following Italy’s 18-16 loss to Scotland at RWC 2007.\n")), \

The number eight was 40 years and 26 days old when he took to the field against South Africa at Hampden Park, a fortnight after his try set Uruguay on the way to a 27-15 win against Spain.\nOrmaechea’s legacy in rugby lives on through his sons, Iñaki, Agustín and Juan Diego, who have all represented their country at rugby. Agustin and Juan Diego followed in their father’s footsteps by appearing at a Rugby World Cup, while Iñaki played sevens.\nBerchesi’s 15-point haul against Fiji is a Uruguayan record for the most points scored in a Rugby World Cup match.\nUruguay only had 22 full-time professional players going into Rugby World Cup 2019.\n“I’m really proud of my country, we’re not the biggest, we’re not the tallest but we came here to win.

I don’t think I will ever forget it,” the centre recalled in a recent interview with World Rugby.\n“Because we were the underdog, the crowd were behind us when we did something good or special, and when I scored, they went mental.\n“It is my best rugby memory.”\nLow point: Suffering the largest defeat in Rugby World Cup history\nJapan conceded more points in losing 145-17 to the All Black at RWC 1995, but the 142 unanswered points hosts Australia scored against Namibia at the Adelaide Oval at RWC 2003 is the biggest defeat.\nThe Wallabies raced past the century mark inside 53 minutes – far quicker than the likes of Don Bradman had managed at the famous cricketing venue in the past – and went on to score 22 unanswered tries as Namibia fell off tackle after tackle.\nIconic player: Jacques Burger\nWithout a doubt Namibia’s most famous player of all time. Started all 36 of his tests for Namibia and appeared at three Rugby World Cups (2007, 2011 and 2015), captaining the team in the latter two tournaments.\nRecord-breaker: Eugene Jantjies\nThe versatile half-back is the only player to represent Namibia at four Rugby World Cups (2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019), making a total of 14 appearances.\nDid you know?\nIn losing 58-14 to New Zealand in their opening game at RWC 2015, Namibia brought up the unwanted record of conceding 1,000 points at Rugby World Cups. Only four other teams have done so: USA, Canada, Romania and Japan.\nQuote:\n‘I’ve coached a lot of people, I’m passionate about rugby. But good grief, when I turned up here, these guys train in the early hours in the morning, then they go to work, they come home at night to do more training and then do their pool recovery in between, yet I haven’t heard one moan.

With the scores locked at 9-9 at full-time and 12-12 in extra-time, the destiny of the Webb Ellis Cup was still undecided until Joel Stransky received the ball from Joost van der Westhuizen and drop kicked himself and the Springboks into history.\nIconic moment: While the sight of Nelson Mandela presenting the Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar in the Springbok captain’s number six jersey in 1995 will forever remain the iconic image of Rugby World Cup, Siya Kolisi leading the Springboks to victory in 2019 as the team’s first black captain is right up there, too.\nLow point: Ten places and just over 13 points separated the sides in the World Rugby Men’s Rankings when South Africa and Japan met on day two of RWC 2015. Japan had not won a RWC match since 1991, while South Africa were world champions in both 1995 and 2007. Nobody gave the Brave Blossoms a prayer. But the formbook went out the window as the Springboks succumbed to the biggest shock in the tournament’s history, losing 34-32 to a late try from Karne Hesketh.\xa0\nIconic player: Chester Williams. Now sadly deceased, Williams became only the third non-white player to play for the Springboks in 1993. Two years later, he was the reluctant poster boy of Rugby World Cup 1995. Injury delayed his involvement at RWC 1995 until the quarter-finals but he made an instant impression with four tries against Samoa and then went on to play a pivotal role in the semi-final and final.\nRecord-breaker: Anyone who shares a record with Jonah Lomu must be good, very good, and Bryan Habana definitely falls into that category. The lightning-quick winger equalled Lomu’s record of most tournament tries when he completely his hat-trick in a 64-0 win against USA at RWC 2015 to take his overall tally to 15.\nDid you know? Jannie de Beer’s ‘nap-hand’ of drop goals against England in the 1999 quarter-finals is a record for a single Rugby World Cup match.\nQuote: “I dropped down to my knees just to say a quick prayer and before I realised it, everybody was around me. All the tension of the six weeks, everything that led to the final just came to the fore, it was very, very emotional. I was incredibly proud of the team, proud of that moment and very much proud to be a Springbok rugby player.” – Francois Pienaar, after the Springboks won the RWC 1995 final.\n')), \

Jonathan Sexton and Ronan O'Gara kicked two penalties each and Sexton also landed a drop goal, but credit for Ireland’s first-ever Rugby World Cup win over the then Tri-Nations champions must also go to the Irish pack who were magnificent on the day.\nIconic moment: Gordon Hamilton’s try against Australia. Ireland suffered more quarter-final heartache in the end, but the flanker’s brilliant charge to the line gave Ireland the lead and hope that they could beat the Wallabies. Lansdowne Road erupted as he crashed over at the end of a breathless run, but eventual champions Australia kept their composure and snatched the game at the death thanks to a try from Michael Lynagh.\nLow point: Ireland had won the previous five meetings with Argentina leading into their RWC 2015 quarter-final in Cardiff. But they were blown away by a rampant Los Pumas side who effectively had the game sewn up once they led 17-0 inside the first quarter. What made the final scoreline of 43-20 against them all the more surprising was that Ireland had been one of the form teams up until that point.\nIconic player: Brian O’Driscoll. Most of Brian O’Driscoll magical moments seemed to come in the Six Nations, however the centre did still manage seven tries in a joint-record 17 tournament appearances. Eight of those appearances were as captain, in 2007 and 2011.\nRecord-breaker: Ronan O’Gara is Ireland’s all-time leading points scorer in Rugby World Cups. The Munster legend accumulated 93 points in 14 appearances, 15 more than former World Rugby Player of the Year 2018 Johnny Sexton.\nDid you know? The only forwards to score four tries in a Rugby World Cup match were both Irish.

Twenty-nine per cent of those points came from two of the greatest-ever kickers to grace the Rugby World Cup stage in Gavin Hastings and Chris Paterson.\nSince reaching the semi-finals of the second tournament in 1991, the furthest Scotland have gone in the competition is the quarter-finals. And having missed out on the knockout stages for only the second time in 2019, after a defeat to Japan, they will be desperate to make amends at France 2023.\nWe take a look at Scotland’s Rugby World Cup story.\nRWC debut: 23 May, 1987 v France at Lancaster Park, ChristchurchRWC appearances: Played 42 – Won 24 Drawn 1 Lost 17 – Points for 1,261 Points against 803 – Winning ratio 57 per cent\nMost RWC appearances: Chris Paterson, 15\nMost RWC tries: Gavin Hastings, 9\nBest finish: Semi-finalists in 1991\nQualification for RWC 2023: Third in Pool A at RWC 2019\nMost memorable match: The breathtaking 36-33 win against Samoa at St James’ Park in Newcastle in 2015. Greig Laidlaw scored 26 points – his best ever haul in a single test – in a bonkers game of rugby that produced seven tries and booked Scotland a quarter-final against Australia.\nIconic moment: Chris Paterson kicking Scotland into the RWC 2007 quarter-finals with every point in their narrow 18-16 win over Italy, part of his then record run of 36 consecutive successful kicks at goal in international rugby.\nLow point: Gavin Hastings’ miss in front of the posts in the 1991 semi-final against England – a kick that could have sent Scotland through to the final. The scores were tied at 6-6 at the time and Jonathan Webb’s second penalty of the match won it for England instead. Hastings later said the miss was his biggest regret in rugby: “If I could change one thing in my career, it would be putting that kick over.”\nIconic player: Hastings kicked far more than he missed in his three tournament appearances and held the individual record for most Rugby World Cup points until Jonny Wilkinson overtook his tally of 227 points from 13 matches in the RWC 2007 quarter-finals.\nRecord-breaker: Chris Paterson is the only Scotland player to have played in four Rugby World Cups (1999-2011). The last of his record 15 tournament appearances, against England in Auckland in 2011, was also his farewell test.\nDid you know? Scotland’s tally of 34 points against Australia in their RWC 2015 quarter-final was the joint second highest number of points scored by a team in a RWC match without them winning the game. (Wales’ 37 v New Zealand at RWC 2003 is the highest).\nQuote: “To play against Jonah Lomu (in 1995) was the ultimate test although he was still relatively unknown at the time. I was pretty quick and there weren’t that many people I could show the outside to and not catch, but he was phenomenally fast for such a big man and incredibly light on his feet too.” – Scotland winger Craig Joiner on the thrill, and challenge, of facing rugby’s most iconic player on the game’s biggest stage.\n')), \

Okay, it’s a loss but the manner in which Wales played, when all the odds were stacked against them, will live long in the memory. Having suffered a Six Nations whitewash earlier in the year, Wales arrived in Australia with little expectation on them to do well. Free from any pressure, they ripped into New Zealand in their final pool game and led 37-33 with just over 25 minutes to go by playing an exhilarating brand of rugby. It did not last as the All Blacks came roaring back to score 20 unanswered points, but in terms of entertainment, that match is right up there with the best. Wales took that form into the quarter-final against England and again had their more vaunted opponents on the back foot until England, like New Zealand, managed to find a way to change the course of the game and pull through.\nIconic moment: Paul Thorburn’s touchline kick to win the bronze medal at the inaugural tournament in 1987. Adrian Hadley’s try had brought Wales to within one point of Australia, but they were still reliant on their nerveless full-back to slot the extra two points to secure victory. Thorburn obliged and Wales went home with their heads held high.\nLow point: Nineteen minutes into the Rugby World Cup 2011 semi-final between Wales and France at Eden Park, Wales captain Sam Warburton was sent off for a dangerous tip-tackle on Vincent Clerc. Despite playing with 14 men for three-quarters of the match, Wales came agonisingly close to reaching their first final, but Les Bleus held on to win 9-8.\nIn terms of being on the receiving end of shock results, look no further than the 1991 loss to Western Samoa. Samoa beat them again in 1999, before the Pacific Island jinx continued with defeat to Fiji at RWC 2007.\nIconic player: Shane Williams. Gareth Thomas scored a hat-trick on his debut against Japan at Rugby World Cup 1995, but Williams outscored the former Wales captain overall. In 11 appearances across three Rugby World Cups, the pocket-rocket winger danced his way to 10 tries and was also responsible for countless try assists.\nRecord-breaker: Josh Adams became the first Welshman to be top try-scorer at a Rugby World Cup when he ran in seven tries in as many games at RWC 2019.\nDid you know? Wales conceded just five tries and 56 points in six matches up to their bronze final showdown with Australia at RWC 2011.\nQuote: “It’s safe to say that’s the most people I’ve ever had watch me train – or watch one of my club games.” – Wales prop Rhys Carre, the youngest player in the squad and appearing at his first Rugby World Cup, on the open training session in Kitakyushu when 15,000 Japanese sang the Welsh national anthem.\n')), \

The game was settled in France’s favour in the dying throes when, with the scores tied at 24-24, a Barbarian-style attack that weaved from one side of the pitch to the other and involved several players, ended with Serge Blanco’s spectacular dive in the corner.\nIconic moment: It was the day that David Campese established himself as one of the greats of the game. Campese scored a try with an arcing run to the line and set up another for Tim Horan with an audacious no-look, switch pass. The All Blacks had never lost a Rugby World Cup match up until that point, but they hadn’t banked on coming up against a player at his mercurial best.\nLow point: Barely 30 seconds were left in Sydney when Jonny Wilkinson became a rugby immortal with a drop goal that denied the Wallabies the opportunity to become the first side to claim back-to-back titles in 2003. Losing in extra-time to England in the final of their home tournament was even more deflating than their quarter-final exit at the hands of their great rivals in 1995 – a fate they also suffered twice more, in 2007 and 2019.\nIconic player: David Campese. Player of the tournament at RWC 1991, the goose-stepping winger was at the heart of everything good about the Wallabies’ game. Campese used his mesmerising skills to score six tries and create many more for his team-mates.\nRecord-breaker: Australia’s 35-12 win over France in 1999 is the biggest margin of victory in a RWC final. Having produced their ‘cup final’ performance against the All Blacks in the semi-final, France struggled to raise their game and were thoroughly outplayed in Cardiff. Ben Tune and Owen Finegan scored tries for the Wallabies and the trusty boot of Matt Burke accounted for the rest of their points.\nDid you know? Opponents had no answer to the defensive system master-minded by cross-code coach John Muggleton at RWC 1999.

Martyn Williams’ 73rd-minute try appeared to have won it for Wales, but salvation came in the unlikely form of prop Graham Dewes, who burrowed over for his first and only test try to send Fiji through to the quarter-finals.\nIconic moment: Fiji’s first-ever Rugby World Cup win was made all the more poignant by the fact they very nearly didn’t make it to New Zealand in 1987. A military coup on the eve of the tournament had placed their participation in doubt and the organisers had Western Samoa on standby. With such a chaotic build-up, Fiji couldn’t have asked for a better start than a 28-9 victory against Hugo Porta’s Argentina.\nLow point: Losing 30-27 to Uruguay – a side ranked nine places below them in the World Rugby Men’s Rankings – at Rugby World Cup 2019.

After scoring a belter of a try against France, Caucaunibuca, returned from a two-game suspension in dramatic style at RWC 2003 with a first-half brace against Scotland in Sydney. In a demonstration of power and pace, the enigmatic winger bulldozed his way down the left touchline for his first before adding another after a 70-metre run that left Scottish defenders clutching at thin air and trailing in his wake. “Give it to Caucau and he is go-go, gone!” exclaimed the match commentator. Unfortunately for Fiji, they fell just short with Tom Smith’s try settling the match 22-20 in Scotland’s favour.\nRecord-breaker: Vereniki Goneva became Fiji’s record try scorer at Rugby World Cups when he touched down for his fifth tournament try in the RWC 2015 defeat to Wales.

Goneva was unable to add to his tally in two appearances in Japan but is still his country’s best ‘finisher’ at Rugby World Cups.\nDid you know?

That said, they did manage 13 in reply and fulfilled their target of finishing within 100 points of their more celebrated opponents.\nIconic player: Pedro LealLeal is a veteran of four Rugby World Cups – one in 15s and three in sevens (2005, 2009 and 2013). He started three games at full-back in 2007 before becoming a star on the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series. With 1,278 points, he is the 13th highest scorer in World Series history.\nDid you know?\nThe Uva brothers, Vasco and Goncalo, played in the pack together at RWC 2007, alongside their cousin, Joao.\nPortugal’s head coach in 2007, Tomaz Morais had to cut short his playing career due to a back injury. The former international became a published author and a university professor as well as a successful coach. He was shortlisted for the World Rugby Coach of the Year Award in 2004.\nHead coach Patrice Lagisquet scored four tries for France at the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 and played in the final against New Zealand. The winger also appeared at RWC 1991, making the last of his 46 appearances for Les Bleus in the quarter-final defeat to England.\nCurrent assistant coach Luis Pissarra was a scrum-half with the national team from 1996-2007 and appeared in all four games at RWC 2007.\nQuote: \n")), \

They have also made three other Rugby World Cup finals, in 1991, 2007 and 2019, missing out on the coveted prize on each occasion.\nWe take a look back at England’s Rugby World Cup story.\nRWC debut: 23 May, 1987 v Australia at Concord Oval, Sydney\nRWC appearances: Played 50 – Won 36 Drawn 0 Lost 14 – Points for 1,569 Points against 783 – Win percentage (72 per cent)\nMost RWC appearances: Jason Leonard 22 (1991-2003)\nMost RWC tries: Rory Underwood, 11\nBest finish: Champions (2003)\nQualification for RWC 2023: Losing finalists at RWC 2019\nMost memorable match: Matches against France are always eagerly-awaited and keenly-fought given the historical rivalry between the two nations, but the Rugby World Cup 1991 version of ‘Le Crunch’ was off the scale in intensity. Tempers were frayed and punches laid in the cauldron-like atmosphere of the Parc des Princes. England’s 19-10 victory is best remembered not for any of the scores – Rory Underwood and Will Carling got tries for England and Jean-Baptiste Lafond crossed for Les Bleus – but Micky Skinner’s thunderous tackle on Marc Cécillon.\nIconic moment: Jonny Wilkinson’s match-winning, extra-time drop goal in the Rugby World Cup 2003 final is beyond dispute as the most celebrated moment in English rugby history. Almost as iconic is Ian Robertson’s commentary of how the event unfolded before his eyes on BBC Radio. “This is the one, it’s coming back for Jonny Wilkinson... He drops for World Cup glory... It’s up, it’s over, he’s done it!”\nLow point: Becoming the first host nation to fail to make the knockout stages in 2015. With three of their pool opponents ranked in the top 10 in the World Rugby Men’s Rankings, it was never going to be easy ride for Stuart Lancaster’s side but defeats to Wales and Australia, in between wins against Fiji and Uruguay, saw them fall well short of expectations.\nIconic player: Wilkinson is again the obvious choice but without Martin Johnson’s leadership it is doubtful England would have got as far as they did in Australia. Written off by the local press as ‘Dad’s Army’, England had a lot of experienced players within the squad, but Johnson was the pillar upon which their successful campaign was built.\nRecord-breaker: Jonny Wilkinson kicked 14 drop goals in Rugby World Cups – more than twice as many as his nearest rival, Springbok Jannie de Beer. He is also comfortably the highest points scorer in Rugby World Cup history with 277 points across his four tournaments.\nDid you know? England had to qualify for the 1999 tournament and booked their place after wins against Italy (23-15) and the Netherlands (110-0)\nQuote: “We got the scrum and cleared our lines, and everyone patted me on the backside. It was great to be part of that moment,” Micky Skinner recalls what happened in the aftermath of his ‘monster munch’ of a tackle on Cécillon.\n')), \

But, in the last two tournaments, they have arguably been the main success story outside of actually lifting the Webb Ellis Cup.\nAfter 24 years without a Rugby World Cup victory and a tournament record 145-17 loss along the way, Japan pulled off the biggest shock in the tournament’s history in beating South Africa in 2015, before going on to make the last eight for the first time when they hosted in 2019.\nThe Brave Blossoms’ brand of exciting rugby makes them a pleasure to watch, but perhaps a team to avoid in the draw.\nWe take a look at Japan’s Rugby World Cup story.\nRWC debut: 24 May, 1987 – v USA at Ballymore, Brisbane\nRWC appearances: Played 33 – Won 8 Draw 2 Lost 23 – Points for 644 Points against 1,347 – Win ratio 24 per cent\nMost RWC appearances: Luke Thompson, 14\nMost RWC tries: Kotaro Matsushima, 6\nBest finish: Quarter-finalists (2019)\nQualification for RWC 2023: Quarter-finalists in 2019\nMost memorable match: It can’t be anything other than the ‘Miracle of Brighton’, Japan’s ground-breaking, odds-defying 34-32 win at Rugby World Cup 2015. Without a RWC win for 24 years and only one victory to their name in the same number of matches, against Zimbabwe, the Brave Blossoms weren’t given a prayer of upsetting the mighty Springboks. But Japan’s brand of high-tempo rugby caused South Africa no end of problems and they became victims of the biggest shock in Rugby World Cup history.\nIconic moment: On-field – the sheer delight on the faces of Japan’s players and fans as Karne Hesketh scored the match-winning try against the Springboks in 2015. Off-field – the moment it was announced the monumental clear-up effort in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis had not been in vain and Japan’s crucial pool match with Scotland would go ahead.\nLow point: Conceding a record 145 points to the All Blacks in 1995.\nIconic player: Japan’s ‘Captain Fantastic’ Michael Leitch. Led Japan a record-equalling seven times at Rugby World Cup from the blindside, with an impressive win ratio of 71 per cent during his spell in charge. Born in New Zealand but regarded by the Japanese as one of their own. In 2019, a national poll named him the second most recognisable person in Japan, behind only the Prime Minister.\nRecord-breaker: Goal-kicking full-back Ayumu Goromaru became the poster boy for Japanese rugby after his exploits at England 2015. Goromaru scored a try in a record 24-point contribution in the win over South Africa and finished the tournament with 58 points from four appearances.\nDid you know? In 2015, Japan became the first team to win three matches in the pool stages of a Rugby World Cup yet still fail to qualify for the knockout stages. They made sure of their historic place in the quarter-finals as hosts in 2019, topping Pool A with victories against Russia, Samoa, Ireland and Scotland.\nQuote: “Looking back, since 2011 this team has grown so much, it’s scary ... we’ve now made history but what’s ahead of us is important. This (a quarter-final) is not the goal. Winning the next game is the goal. Win the next, then the next. What’s important is winning the game in front of us. We want to make even more history for Japan.” – Michael Leitch on Japan not being satisfied with a first-ever RWC quarter-final but hungry for more success\n')), \

Ignacio Corleto scored the only try with the rest of the points coming from the boots of David Skrela and Felipe Contepomi. The result left the 80,000 Stade de France crowd stunned. It wasn’t a one-off either, as Los Pumas returned to Paris later in the tournament and beat the host nation for a second time to claim the bronze medal.\xa0\nIconic moment: Diego Maradona dancing with the team in the changing room after they defeated Tonga 45-16 in Leicester en route to the RWC 2015 semi-finals.\xa0\nLow point: Losing their opening game of RWC 2019 against France to a late, long-range drop goal from Camille Lopez. The result proved pivotal to the make-up of Pool C, with Les Bleus finishing runners-up to England at Los Pumas’ expense. It was the first time since 2003 that they hadn’t progressed beyond the pool stages.\nIconic player: Agustín Pichot. With his Latin good looks and long flowing hair, Pichot always had the makings of being a rugby superstar. A natural leader, Los Pumas’ talisman produced a series of outstanding performances at RWC 2007 and was integral to them achieving their best-ever finish of third.\nRecord-breaker: Fly-half Gonzalo Quesada finished RWC 1999 as the tournament’s top scorer with 102 points, a tally that included a record 31 penalties. He was one point clear of Australia’s Matt Burke and five clear of South Africa’s Jannie de Beer in a tournament where kickers had a massive role to play.\nDid you know? Argentina only won one of their first 10 Rugby World Cup matches (25-16 v Italy in 1987). A 32-16 win against Samoa at RWC 1999 finally brought their barren run to an end.\nQuote: “Apart from playing for third place, the team played for what has been talked about at a lot at press conferences, they played for how they feel the game, for that sentiment of romanticism.” – Agustín Pichot waxes lyrical after the bronze final in Paris in 2007.\n')), \

Arthur Jones and Ieuan Evans both hit back for Wales in the final quarter after finally managing to make some headway in the face of a fierce defensive effort from the Samoans. Each side converted one of their tries but with Mathew Vaea out-kicking Mark Ring two penalties to one, it was Samoa who came out on top.\nIconic moment: To\'o Vaega’s try v Wales. \nWith the match against Wales on a knife-edge at 3-3 at half-time, Samoa struck the first blow of the second half when Vaega scored their first-ever Rugby World Cup try – and what a try it was! Receiving the ball just in the Welsh half in the 42nd minute, the pacey outside centre cut through the defensive line with a rapid burst of acceleration before kicking ahead, while at full speed, and beating Robert Jones to the touchdown.\nLow point: Being ‘nilled’ by Scotland. \nWhen Samoa were beaten 34-0 by Scotland at Rugby World Cup 2019, it was the first time the team had failed to score in the tournament. Ed Fidow’s dismissal for two yellow card offences only added salt into the wounds.\nIconic player: Brian Lima. \nWhile famous names like Frank Bunce, Steve Bachop, Pat Lam, Apollo Perelini and Va\'aiga Tuigamala have all worn the blue jersey with distinction at a Rugby World Cup before, there can be no argument that winger Brian Lima is the player to have made the biggest impact in every sense of the word. The fearsome tackler was the first player to appear in five Rugby World Cups (1991 to 2007) – a feat now matched by Mauro Bergamasco and Sergio Parisse.\nRecord-breaker:\nAt Rugby World Cup 2003, Lima broke the record for consecutive tournament appearances (16).\nDid you know?\nVavae Tuilagi became the fifth Tuilagi brother to play at a Rugby World Cup when he appeared against South Africa in the 2015 edition; his brothers Freddie, Henry and Alesana have all featured for Samoa in the tournament while Manu played for England in 2011.\xa0\nQuote:\n"It\'s definitely the hardest tackle I\'ve taken in my life but I\'m still breathing and that\'s a good sign."\nSouth Africa fly-half Derick Hougaard on the thumping tackle he received from Lima at RWC 2003.\n')), \
